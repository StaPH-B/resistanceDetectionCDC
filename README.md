## File Descriptions:

Resfinderdrugkey012219.xlsx - A lookup table used by the National Antimicrobial Resistance Survillence Team at CDC to predict antibiotic resistance using the presense/absense of resistance genes. 

dfrA34 - A novel trimethoprim resistance gene recently discovered by our group, not yet in ResFinder database. Referece - PMID: 30202900 DOI: 10.1093/jac/dky373

narmsWF.sh - Bash workflow used to assemble / analyze genomes. Script is formatted for use on CDC's computational cluster so update paths before using. 

plasmidDatabase.fasta - Plasmid database used by our group based largely on PlasmidFinder. Includes additional targets of interest and more up to date plasmid nomenclature. 

pointfinder050218.xlsx - A lookup table used by the National Antimicrobial Resistance Survillence Team at CDC to predict antibiotic resistance using the presense/absense of resistance encoding mutations in housekeeping genes.
